IMPROVEMENTS

* More detailed event error messages for connections. 

* Support new Monit 5.3 features, program execution and
  every crontab format.

* MySQL client upgraded to 5.1.x (tested with 5.1.x and 5.5.x servers).

BUG FIXES:

* Fix lockup when sqlite is used and multiple hosts have the same monitid.

* Fix buttons click handling for iOS clients (iPhone/iPad).

* Alert mail delivery: If the SMTP server returned error code >= 550,
  try to deliver the message to the remaining recipients. Originally
  the SMTP transaction continued in the case of error only if 550 code
  was returned.



Version 2.3.4
-------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* The IP-address of Monit is now automatically set based on the address
  reported by Monit. M/Monit previously set the address based on the
  connection made by Monit and updated the IP-address only once when the
  host is new. If a proxy was setup in front of M/Monit this address
  would be of the proxy and not of the Monit host. By making Monit
  report its IP-address, the address should always be correct and
  current since Monit reports the address at connection time. 

  Because the Monit IP-address now automatically is set by Monit, users
  can no longer change this address manually. If you need to specify
  another outbound address for Monit, click the "Firewall/NAT/Proxy?"
  link in admin/hosts/edit page and specify the address in the "Outbound
  IP-address for Monit" field.

* Users can now enter a DNS hostname in Monit's outbound IP-address
  field and the name will be resolved when M/Monit connects to Monit.
  This is useful and more flexible if the Monit host changes its
  IP-address (frequently e.g. via DHCP).

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed crash which could happen when processing message from Monit.



Version 2.3.3
-------------

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Changed user's default refresh settings for charts and tables from
  1 minute to 5 seconds so monit status changes and new events reload
  faster in the GUI.

* Improved SQLite thread-locking strategy

BUG FIXES:

* The descriptive hostname is only updated once for new hosts so it 
  can be overridden by admin later. In previous versions, M/Monit
  continued to updated and overwrite the hostname based on the DNS 
  name of the host.

* If Monit's id file is empty for some reason, M/Monit reported that 
  Monit is older than the required version, even if the version was OK.
  The id attribute was moved in Monit 5.2 and if M/Monit did not find 
  the id element, it assumed that the Monit version was too old. The 
  error message has been fixed to describe the problem correctly.

* Fixed a problem if two hosts had the same hostname a JSON error 
  occurred when adding a new alert rule.


Version 2.3.2
-------------

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Security: updated openssl to 1.0.0b. See OpenSSL security advisor;
  http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20101116.txt
  To prevent further OpenSSL problems in this area we have also 
  disabled the OpenSSL session cache in M/Monit.

* Updated SQLite to version 3.7.3

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed events link from status detail to the events page. The
  link had an extra path level which when clicked caused the
  events detail page not to be properly styled when viewed from
  the events page. Thanks to Jody Clements for reporting the problem.



Version 2.3.1
-------------

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Faster cache load on M/Monit startup.

* Updated to YUI version 2.8.2

BUG FIXES:

* GTalk: M/Monit previously sent jabber messages of type "headline" 
  which talk.google.com no longer seems to deliver. The message type
  has therefor been changed to "normal" which work.


Version 2.3
-----------

NOTE:

* M/Monit 2.3 requires Monit 5.2 or later

IMPROVEMENTS:

* New Report pages for hosts and services uptime and downtime.
  
* Added execution of user defined programs/scripts as an alert
  option when receiving events from Monit

* Improved user interface

* Host details: 
  * New charts: swap memory, CPU and memory
  * Service data displayed in a new pop-out panel
  * Sorted port response time chart

* Optional automatic registration of Monit credentials 
  
* Internal cache improvements

* TCP/IP and SSL improvements. Should improve communication
  over low-bandwidth and saturated networks. 

* Reduced memory usage. Not that M/Monit used a lot of memory 
  before, but now it use even less. 

BUG FIXES:

* Make M/Monit less strict when handling SMTP multi-line responses.
  Thanks to Barynin Konstantin for letting us know.

* Fix crash during mmonit start on FreeBSD-8.x

* Workaround libpthread bug in OS X which caused one CPU core to max
  out and M/Monit to become unresponsive if run in background mode. 
  M/Monit now works fine in daemon mode on OS X.
  
* Fixed infrequent connection close. In some situations M/Monit
  could drop connections in mid-communication if the client was
  "slow" to respond.

* Fixed login problems for user account during which's create/edit
  some input data format check failed and the form was re-submitted
  after correction of the input.
  


Version 2.2.1
-------------

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Changed name of admin menu item "Rules" to "Alerts" to make it
  clearer that this page is used for setting up alert rules.

* Accept messages from future Monit versions (no need to upgrade
  M/Monit when Monit is extended).

BUG FIXES:

* Fix JSON error in rules admin page, when empty hostgroup was
  defined. Thanks to Balazs Boros for report.
  
* Fixed a problem in service cache that could drain the database
  connection pool.



Version 2.2
-----------

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Added support for Monit 5.1 (required to support multiple
  service groups per service which was added in Monit 5.1).

* Allow non-fully qualified domain name in mail addresses

* Added automatic synchronization of services and service group
  names with Monit. Services that are no longer configured in any
  Monit agent configuration file are not displayed in the rules
  admin drop-down menu. Likewise, if new services are added to a
  Monit agent it will be displayed and made available when
  setting up alert rules in M/Monit. The Events page will still
  display removed services in the drill-down filter if there are
  events referring to old removed services.

* When specifying a rule, the service menu is context sensitive,
  that is, the menu list only services that belongs to the
  selected host. If a host group is selected, only services that
  are common for all hosts in the group.

* M/Monit database schema version added and checked on startup.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed alert mail duplication which could occur in some
  situations. Thanks to George Agnelli for bug report.

* Fixed sporadic long waits when doing an action on a service in
  the status detailed page. When M/Monit performs a start, stop
  restart etc on a service it waits up to 30 seconds for a reply
  from Monit before it times out. In some situations, especially
  if Monit is running in a virtual machine, Monit could reply
  before M/Monit started its wait, which would result in M/Monit
  waiting the full 30 seconds before timeout.

* Fixed a crash that could occur if a host was added to a
  non-existent host group. Thanks to Jarod Reid for report.

* Fixed initial sorting of host names in the host admin table.

* If several sessions were open for the same user and password
  changed, the new password was not applied until all the
  sessions had terminated. This is now fixed and password changes
  takes effect immediately.

* Monit 5.1 now makes sure that it sends heartbeat to M/Monit
  even if it is busy in long testing cycles to prevent false
  alerts generated by M/Monit about non-responsive Monit agents.


Version 2.1.1
-------------

IMPROVEMENTS:

* In admin/hosts, if an outbound IP-address was specified for
  Monit, display this address in the hosts table.

* Allow non-fully qualified domain for jabber users.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a thread storage problem that caused M/Monit virtual
  memory usage to grow during event processing. This in turn 
  could lead M/Monit to grow out of available virtual memory
  and to a full stop. Many thanks to Asim for bug report.



Version 2.1
-----------

NEW FEATURES:

* M/Monit will now send an alert if a Monit agent does not report
  in on time.

* Various caching strategies has been added internally. This
  should help M/Monit scale to hundreds of hosts and beyond.

* Replaced the Host drop down menu with a host search field in
  the events page.

* Host groups can now be used, in addition to hosts, when
  specifying an alert rule.
  
* Service groups can now be used, in addition to services, when
  specifying an alert rule. A service group is defined in your
  monitrc control file

* M/Monit can now send Jabber/GTalk alert messages in addition to 
  Mail messages. 
  
* The M/Monit server now supports SSL. See the manual and the
  description of <Connector> and <Host> in server.xml for how to
  configure M/Monit to use SSL.
  
* The web user interface has got a modest face lift.

BUG FIXES:

* Evaluate all rules when processing events for sending alerts.
  Previous versions only evaluated and acted on the first
  matching rule. Thanks to Andrew Stott for report.

* Services and service groups are now pre-fetched from Monit when
  Monit starts up and report to M/Monit. In earlier versions of
  M/Monit, an event had to occur on a service before the service
  was made available when specifying alert rules. Note: this
  feature requires Monit-5.1, Monit-5.0.3 will also work, but
  service names won't be synced.
  
* Added timezone in date header for mails sent by M/Monit. Thanks 
  to Thorsten Kampe for requesting this feature.

* Fixed a possible crash in Dashboard when an event from Monit
  was received with a system time ahead of M/Monit's system time.
  Thanks to Aleksander Kamenik for report.

* Improved the AJAX host search field to allow for a more
  interactive search

* Improved mail queue handling

* FreeBSD releases of M/Monit are now built using FreeBSD version
  6.0 and 7.0 instead of version 6.4 and 7.2. This allows M/Monit
  to support a wider range of 6.x and 7.x FreeBSD OS versions.


Version 2.0.3
-------------

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a potential NumberFormatException error when clicking on
  a host row in the host status page. Many thanks to Aleksander
  Kamenik for finding this bug and helping us resolve it.

* The grey delete icon in admin tables is changed to a red icon
  on mouse hover to give better UI feedback.
  
* Ignore invalid cookies. Previous versions aborted the request
  with a 404 error. Thanks to Ron McKown for debug help.
  
* In the admin page only display real active login sessions.

* Expanded host table columns platformname, platformrelease,
  platformversion, platformmachine to allow for up to 255
  characters.



Version 2.0.2
-------------

NEW FEATURES:

* You can now change the name and description of host groups.

* Quick delete added to admin page tables for hosts, users and
  rules. These tables have now a new delete icon in the rightmost
  column. Clicking on the icon deletes the table entry. This is a
  shortcut so you don't have to open the entry first to delete
  it. Thanks to Nicola Tiling for suggestion.

* Added Monit version information to admin/hosts table. This
  allows you to quickly see which Monit version is running on
  each host. Thanks to Aleksander Kamenik for suggestion.

* Increased skew rate for Monit agents from 2 to 3 cycles.

* OpenBSD support added.

* Updated all shared libraries to latest version.

BUG FIXES:

* Stability fixes.

* Internal performance improvements in the connection pool driver
  for SQLite. The new changes makes SQLite scale much better and
  able to handle many more hosts.

* Expanded host.platformrelease column in the database to allow
  for up to 100 characters. Some OS use a long release name which
  did not fit in the original 20 characters limit used in the
  database. M/Monit could refuse message from these hosts and not
  update the host status. Thanks to Aaron Scamehorn for report.

* Increased read timeout from 3 seconds to 30 seconds when
  communicating with SMTP servers to allow for slow servers.

* Fixed possible "Number format exception" error when trying to
  open host status or use host admin for monit hosts which were
  imported from older M/Monit versions. Thanks to Nicola Tiling
  for report.

* Fix possible OpenSolaris crash. Thanks to Christoffer Torris
  Olsen for report.
  


Version 2.0.1
-------------

* Added missing files to SDK.


Version 2.0
-----------

CHANGES:

* M/Monit now has the following event states:
     - succeeded
     - failed
     - changed
  The states, match, instance and action has been folded
  into the changed state.
