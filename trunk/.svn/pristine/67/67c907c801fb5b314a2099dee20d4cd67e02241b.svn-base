 
                       M/Monit version 2.x
 
 Introduction
 ------------
 
 M/Monit is a system for automatic management and monitoring of
 Information Technology Systems. M/Monit can monitor and manage
 distributed computer systems, conduct automatic maintenance and
 repair and execute meaningful causal actions in error situations.
 
 M/Monit expand upon Monit's capabilities to provide monitoring
 and management of all Monit enabled hosts from one easy to use
 web-interface.
 
 
 System requirements
 -------------------
 
 * M/Monit requires Monit as an agent. A Monit agent send status
   periodically and events immediately to M/Monit which collects
   the information in its database. The Monit agent software must
   be version 5.2 or later and installed on all hosts M/Monit
   should monitor. Download Monit from http://mmonit.com/monit/
 
 * Supported Platforms
 
   See: http://mmonit.com/wiki/MMonit/SupportedPlatforms
 
 * Memory and Disk space
  
   A minimum of 8 megabytes RAM are required and around 20 MB of
   free disk space. You may need more RAM depending on how many
   processor threads the M/Monit server is started with and the
   number of Sessions that are used.
 
 * Accurate time keeping
  
   M/Monit use the time of day for reporting and monitoring and
   it is recommended to investigate if your system clock has the
   correct time and maybe set some time synchronization facility
   on your system.
 
 * Random Device
  
   A random device is needed for creating universal unique and
   cryptographically strong HTTP (and SSL) Session identifiers
   and the Server will complain and exit if it cannot find
   /dev/random or /dev/urandom on the system.
 
 * M/Monit depends only on the C-libraries installed on all POSIX
   systems.
 
 
 Installation
 ------------
 
 M/Monit comes pre-configured and should run right out of the
 box. Simply unpack the M/Monit tar file into a location so that
 the distribution resides in its own directory.
 
 M/Monit utilize Monit as an agent and Monit should be installed
 on all hosts you want M/Monit to manage and monitor.


 Quick start
 -----------

 1) Start M/Monit: <mmonit-home>/bin/mmonit
    Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and login as
    user admin with password swordfish. Make sure that javascript
    is turned on and that your browser accept cookies.

 2) Setup Monit to post events and automatically register itself with
    M/Monit: Put the following into your Monit control file,
    .monitrc:

     set eventqueue basedir /var/monit slots 1000
     # Specify the URL for posting events to M/Monit. The auth. part of
     # the URL, that is, monit:monit, specify a username and password
     # registered in M/Monit. If you change the password for the monit
     # user in M/Monit it must be changed here as well.
     set mmonit http://monit:monit@<M/Monit-host>:8080/collector
     set httpd port 2812 and use address <monit-host>
         allow localhost
         allow <M/Monit-host>
         allow username:password

    where <M/Monit-host> and <monit-host> is the host name or
    IP-address of the host running respectively M/Monit and
    Monit. For extra security you can also configure Monit and
    M/Monit to use SSL. See the M/Monit manual at
    http://mmonit.com/documentation/ for more information.
